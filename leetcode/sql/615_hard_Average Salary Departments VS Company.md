Given two tables as below, write a query to display the comparison result (higher/lower/same) of the average salary of employees in a department to the companyâ€™s average salary.
Table: salary

```
| id | employee_id | amount | pay_date   |
|----|-------------|--------|------------|
| 1  | 1           | 9000   | 2017-03-31 |
| 2  | 2           | 6000   | 2017-03-31 |
| 3  | 3           | 10000  | 2017-03-31 |
| 4  | 1           | 7000   | 2017-02-28 |
| 5  | 2           | 6000   | 2017-02-28 |
| 6  | 3           | 8000   | 2017-02-28 |
```

The employee_id column refers to the employee_id in the following table employee.

```
| employee_id | department_id |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 2             |
| 3           | 2             |
```

So for the sample data above, the result is:

```
| pay_month | department_id | comparison  |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 2017-03   | 1             | higher      |
| 2017-03   | 2             | lower       |
| 2017-02   | 1             | same        |
| 2017-02   | 2             | same        |
```
